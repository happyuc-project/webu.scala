Usage: $0 [Network [Options]]
Network defaults to dev. Other supported values are: main, rinkeby and ropsten.
Options can be any ghuc command-line options that do not conflict or duplicate existing options used.

This script invokes ghuc with the following options:
 - The HappyUC data directory is set to $HAPPYUC_HOME, or a subdirectory that depends on the network chosen; the directory will be created if required.
 - HTTP-RPC server at localhost:8545 is enabled, and all APIs are allowed.
 - HappyUC's experimental Whisper message facility is enabled.
 - Inter-process communication will be via a virtual file located at $HAPPYUC_HOME/ghuc.ipc.
 - WS-RPC server at localhost:8546 is enabled, and all APIs are allowed.
 - Info verbosity is specified.
 - A log file for the ghuc output will be written, or overwritten, in logs/ghuc.log;
   the log/ directory will be created  if it does not already exist.

You will see the message 'No coinbase set and no accounts found as default'.
Coinbase is the index into personal.listAccounts which determines the account to send Huc too.
You can specify this value with this option: --coinbase 0
